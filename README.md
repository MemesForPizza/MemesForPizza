# Welcome!
Hello! I'm MemesForPizza! Currently, I'm still a student and a intermediate programmer, although I don't contribute publicly since I don't feel ready yet. Hope i can contribute some day.

I understand TypeScript/Javascript the most, and some C#, C++, Python. I am still exploring the world of programming!
